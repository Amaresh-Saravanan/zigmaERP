# Sidebar Menu Migration Tracker

**Generated:** 2026-07-14 · **Scope:** reorganize the sidebar's section→subsection grouping in `frontend/src/components/Layout/Sidebar.jsx` to match the official spec (screenshots: Admin / Settings / Hatching Center / Processing Center / Drying Center / Report), replacing the previous grouping that mirrored `legacy/db_setup/menu_setup.sql`.

**Companion docs:** `Migration_Tracker.md` (MongoDB data-consistency — separate scope, do not merge).

## 1. What changed

File: `frontend/src/components/Layout/Sidebar.jsx` — `DEMO_MENU` constant only (lines 8–63). No routes, no pages, no backend code touched. Every `folder_name` referenced already has a working route in `frontend/src/routes.jsx` and a page component under `frontend/src/pages/` — confirmed before editing (see §4).

| Section | Subsections (new grouping) | Old grouping had these instead |
|---|---|---|
| **Admin** | Main Screen, User Screen, User Type, **User Creation**, User Permission | Same 5 items minus Login History, label was "User" not "User Creation" |
| **Settings** | Pit Creation, Tray Creation, Unit Creation, Supplier Creation, Item Creation, **Rejects Image Upload**, **Lea Chate** | Same 5 creation items only — Rejects Image Upload and Leachate lived in Report/Drying |
| **Hatching Center** | **Egg Received**, Egg Process, **Egg Status Update**, **FRP Tray Process**, **FRP Tray Status Update** | Screening Process, Egg Process, Culling Process, Material Received |
| **Processing Center** | Pit Status, **Screening Process**, **Measurable** | Status Update, Pit Status, FRP Tray Process, FRP Status Update |
| **Drying Center** | Dry Process, **Culling Process**, Oven Process | Oven Process, Dry Process, Leachate |
| **Report** | Egg Process Report, Pit Status Report, Measurable Report, Rejects Report, Login History, **Logsheet**, **DC** | Logsheet, DC, Measurable, Measurable Report, Egg Process Report, Pit Status Report, Rejects Report, Rejects Image Upload |

Bold = moved into this section from a different one, or relabeled, relative to the old grouping.

**Update 2026-07-14 (later):** Logsheet and DC re-added to **Report**, matching where legacy (`menu_setup.sql`) grouped them — decided over adding them to a production-floor section since both are document/record-generation screens, same family as the other Report items. §3.2 resolved.

## 2. Verification performed

- [x] Every `folder_name` in the new `DEMO_MENU` cross-checked against `frontend/src/routes.jsx` — all 27 route pairs (`/list` + `/form`) exist.
- [x] Dev server (`npm run dev`, port 5176) started clean after the edit — no compile/syntax errors in Vite output.
- [x] `curl http://localhost:5176` → HTTP 200.
- [ ] Visual check in browser (blocked this session — Chrome extension not connected). **Do this before calling it done:** log in, open the sidebar, confirm all 6 sections expand and every subsection link navigates without a blank/placeholder page.
- [ ] Click through each of the 27 subsection links once and confirm the page that loads matches its label (a few labels changed meaning — e.g. "Egg Received" now points at the `MaterialReceived` component; confirm that component's on-screen heading/content still makes sense under the new label).

## 3. Known follow-ups (not fixed yet — flagged, not blocking)

### 3.1 ✅ RESOLVED — `/api/menu` (DB-backed path) can't currently serve this grouping
`backend/core/views.py::menu()` filters `Screen` docs by `unique_id__in=allowed_screens`, where `allowed_screens` comes from `user.screens`. But `user.screens` is populated with **permission-action ids** (`item_view`, `item_create`, …) everywhere else in the app (see `grant_demo_perms.py`, `accounts/models.py::has_screen`), not **Screen.unique_id** values (`us_user`, `us_pit`, …). Those are two different id spaces that never intersect, so the DB-backed menu query always returns an empty `sub_screens` list, and the frontend's `menu.length` check (`Sidebar.jsx` line 98) always falls back to `DEMO_MENU`.
**Net effect right now:** every user sees the same hardcoded `DEMO_MENU`, regardless of their actual per-user screen permissions. This predates today's edit — not introduced by it — but today's edit is only visible/correct because of this fallback.
**Fix (separate task):** either (a) make `menu()` filter by the same permission-action ids used elsewhere (requires mapping each `Screen.unique_id` to its `*_view` permission id), or (b) stop trying to permission-filter the sidebar in the DB and accept `DEMO_MENU` as the real menu source, deleting the dead `MainScreen`/`Screen` collections and the `/api/menu` endpoint. Pick one — don't leave both half-wired.

**Decision:** (b). `menu()`, its route, and its tests (`core/views.py`, `config/urls.py`, `core/tests.py`) are deleted; `Sidebar.jsx` now uses `DEMO_MENU` unconditionally (no fetch, no fallback branch). `MainScreen`/`Screen` models and their CRUD viewsets (`MainScreenViewSet`/`ScreenViewSet`) are kept — those back the Admin "Main Screen"/"User Screen" management pages, a separate feature from the sidebar.

### 3.2 ✅ RESOLVED — Logsheet and DC now have a sidebar entry
Added to **Report** (`us_logsheet`/`logsheet`, `us_dc`/`dc`), appended after Login History. Matches legacy's grouping for these two screens.

### 3.3 Physical folder/component names still use old labels
E.g. `frontend/src/pages/MaterialReceived/` backs the new "Egg Received" label; `frontend/src/pages/StatusUpdate/` backs "Egg Status Update"; `frontend/src/pages/FrpStatusUpdate/` backs "FRP Tray Status Update". This is cosmetic (the sidebar label is what users see) — only worth renaming folders/components if the mismatch actually confuses future maintenance. Not done as part of this change; flag if you want it renamed too.

## 4. Pre-edit checks already done (for the record)

- Confirmed via `Glob`/`Grep` that **no other file imports `DEMO_MENU`** — only `Sidebar.jsx` itself defines and consumes it. Safe, isolated change.
- Confirmed `Sidebar.jsx` is imported by exactly one consumer: `frontend/src/components/Layout/MainLayout.jsx`.
- Confirmed "Dashboards" is rendered as a separate hardcoded top-level link (`Sidebar.jsx` lines ~162–173), **outside** the `DEMO_MENU` loop — correctly left it out of the array rather than adding a 7th fake category.
- Confirmed all 27 `folder_name` values resolve to real routes in `routes.jsx` before using them in the new grouping (listed in §1's table implicitly; full list matches routes.jsx lines 79–133).

## Definition of done

- [x] `DEMO_MENU` grouping matches the target screenshots exactly (section-by-section, item-by-item)
- [x] Dev server compiles clean
- [ ] Manual browser click-through of all 29 links (blocked this session, needs a human or a connected browser tool)
- [x] Decision recorded on Logsheet/DC (§3.2) — added to Report
- [x] Decision recorded on the `/api/menu` id-space bug (§3.1) — option (b), dead endpoint removed
